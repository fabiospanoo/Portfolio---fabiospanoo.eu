Blade made it easy to reuse components (layout, navbar, project card) and keep every page consistent.\n\nThe admin area lives at /login, it is not linked anywhere on the site, and it requires both a password and a TOTP code. Everything you edit there ends up in plain Blade views rendered server-side - no JavaScript framework needed.",
